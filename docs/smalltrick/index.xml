      <description>Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative. Follow up: Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space? Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Example 2: Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 Output: [3,99,-1,-100] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3] rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100] Constraints: 1 &amp;lt;= nums.</description>

It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.
