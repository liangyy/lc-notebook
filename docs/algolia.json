The trick is to use two pointers which have different speeds. Specifically, let\u0026amp;rsquo;s have two pointers, slow and fast, where fast goes twice as fast as slow.\nThen, we can image that:\n If there is no loop, fast will hit None eventually and we can terminate safely.

Any permutation of [1,2,3] must equally likely to be returned. solution.shuffle(); // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1,2,3]. solution.reset(); // Returns the random shuffling of array [1,2,3]. solution.shuffle(); This is about generating random permutation when we have a random integer generator.\nAs it sounds, it is not a typical question but definitely something need to know (here I\u0026amp;rsquo;d rather treat it as something good to know).\nThe solution mentions about Fisher-Yates shuffle (which I\u0026amp;rsquo;m not aware before). The approach is straight forward. Suppose we have N integers, the way to generate a random permutation is:\n For jth position, randomly select one from the remaining (N - j + 1) elements. Do it from position 1 to N.  Why it works? Since for permutation n1, \u0026amp;hellip;, nN,\n n1 has 1 / N probability to be positioned at the first position. n2 has 1 / (N - 1) probability to be positioned at the second position. And so on so forth.  So, n1, \u0026amp;hellip;, nN has 1 / N! probability to be drawn. As there are N! number of permutations, each one of them has the same probability to be drawn.\nOK, the important thing is how to implement it efficiently. For a naive implementation, we need to remove the elements that have been selected. It requires $O(N)$ time complexity at each draw and overall it needs $O(N^2)$ time complexity to obtain a permutation.\nHow to improve? All we need is to maintain the subarray containing the unselected elements. This can be done by swapping. Specifically, at position j (the place we want to fill in), suppose subarray nums[j:] contains the unselected elements, we can swap the selected one (with index j + random_idx where random_idx is among 0:(N-j)) and the current jth element.

And then, the solution discusses about how to do this in an efficient way. For the latter, it utilizes the trick constantly appearing in handling interval. From my word, we can define an interval by marking up the start and end position. And we read the interval via scanning the list and at each iteration, we grab the information from the previous position and the mark of the current position to know if the current point is in any interval.\nOK, the above discussion is very hand-waving in two senses:\n Why the greedy approach works?

After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day) Example: Input: [1,2,3,0,2] Output: 3 Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell] At first, I thought about dynamic programming with the thought that:\n For the first j days, the best solution is among: 1. the first j-1 day and do nothing at j; 2. bug and sell at kth and jth day, and doing something at the first k-2 days (we need k-2 since we cannot do anything at k-1th day in order to buy at kth day).\n With this idea, it yields an DP algorithm with time complexity $O(N^2)$ since at each time I need to traverse to get the choice of k.\nOK, how to improve? It can be done in linear time ..\nHow about maintaining some finer information? At jth day, all I need to decide is whether I want to buy, sell, or cool down (I have to cool down).

From left to right, when we get increasing characters in a row, we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t need to do any further thing. But when a small character occurs, we want to start over from the small one if the previous characters re-occur in the subsequent strings. But what if some characters do not occur again?

But since the previous string is increasing, to keep the not re-occurring character at the current position is the best solution.\nOK, let\u0026amp;rsquo;s wrap up the idea above into an algorithm. First we need to know if the character is re-occurring after a position. To do so, we can record the last position of each character. Another detail is that whenever we saw a character that have already occurred in the current string, we safely ignore it since to start over at the new one won\u0026amp;rsquo;t give better solution that the current one.\nSumming up, the algorithm is:\n  At position j, if s[j] is not in the current stack (use a dict to maintain this):\n If s[j] \u0026amp;gt; stack[-1], append s[j] to the end of stack If s[j] \u0026amp;lt; stack[-1] and last_position[stack[-1]] \u0026amp;gt; j, pop the top one in the stack until one of the two conditions s[j] \u0026amp;lt; stack[-1] and last_position[stack[-1]] \u0026amp;gt; j do not hold.

Follow up: Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem. Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space? Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3 Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6] rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5] rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4] Example 2: Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2 Output: [3,99,-1,-100] Explanation: rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3] rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100] Constraints: 1 \u0026amp;lt;= nums.length \u0026amp;lt;= 2 * 104 -231 \u0026amp;lt;= nums[i] \u0026amp;lt;= 231 - 1 0 \u0026amp;lt;= k \u0026amp;lt;= 105 The idea is simple, just to keep updating by jumping to new position i \u0026amp;lt;- (i + k) % n. Some minor thing is that we can do k = k % n before getting started. And if k = 0, we can immediately return without doing anything.\nThe difficulty for me is that I know there will be multiple cycles but it is really hard to know beforehand how many cycles are needed. I was thinking about using a for loop to go through all these cycles in order.\nBut, such difficulty can be avoided. Or, we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t need to know the number of cycles beforehand. Instead, we can keep track of the number of positions that have been updated. And whenever we ends one cycle, we can safely go to i \u0026amp;lt;- i + 1 and start a new cycle since we can be sure that it has not been visited. Why? If the next position has been visited by one of the previous ones, no matter which one, we know that the same thing will happen for the next next position as well (since all the previous cycle starts have been visited). Following this, we will have all positions being visited already. So, whenever there is unvisited position, the next position has to be unvisited.\nTo make this idea more generally, essentially, the strategy here is to come up with an order of visiting (no duplicated visit …","date":1602288000,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-10-10T00:00:00Z","objectID":"48a5f0db5a8d48dfcc41cc477408ded6","permalink":"https://liangyy.github.io/lc-notebook/smalltrick/q189/","publishdate":"2020-10-10T00:00:00Z","title":"Q189. Rotate Array"},{"content":"The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the \u0026amp;quot;root.\u0026amp;quot; Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that \u0026amp;quot;all houses in this place forms a binary tree\u0026amp;quot;. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night. Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police. Example 1: Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1] 3 / \\ 2 3 \\ \\ 3 1 Output: 7 Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. Example 2: Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1] 3 / \\ 4 5 / \\ \\ 1 3 1 Output: 9 Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9. As in tree structure, we can say that the problem for the tree can be divided into problems of the left and right subtrees and once we get these subproblems out, we could merge them somehow to get the answer for the full tree.\nIt fits well for tree structure since we don\u0026amp;rsquo;t need to worry about the issue of duplicated work. The root could either be robbed or not and the solution takes the better one among the two.\nno_rob_val(node) = max(rob_val(node.left), no_rob_val(node.left)) + max(rob_val(node.right), no_rob_val(node.right)) rob_val(node) = node.val + no_rob_val(node.left) + no_rob_val(node.right) From here, the first thought is to solve rob_val and no_rob_val separately. But the problem is that rob_val(node) and no_rob_val(node) generates duplicated recursion. More specifically, they ask for no_rob_val(node.left) and no_rob_val(node.right) twice.\nOK, here comes the trick. We can solve the rob_val and no_rob_val in one calculation, simply we calculate no_rob_val(node.left) and no_rob_val(node.right) once and apply to both no_rob_val(node) and rob_val(node).\nSo, it becomes:\nno_rob_val_left, rob_val_left = soln(node.left) no_rob_val_right, rob_val_right = soln(node.right) no_rob_val = …","date":1602288000,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-10-10T00:00:00Z","objectID":"e5038056b198d7292da2c91b0f8846dc","permalink":"https://liangyy.github.io/lc-notebook/smalltrick/q337/","publishdate":"2020-10-10T00:00:00Z","title":"Q337: House Robber III"},{"content":"My wishlist.\n on segment tree on BST inorder traverse  ","date":1604102400,"description":"","lastmod":"2020-10-31T00:00:00Z","objectID":"5d3e79f09a7c0aac955dcc6b9cb3b1e2","permalink":"https://liangyy.github.io/lc-notebook/todo/","publishdate":"2020-10-31T00:00:00Z","title":"To-do list"},{"content":"About This is my LeetCode notebook.\nIt is by no mean systematic but a playground recording what I learned and felt interesting and worth to write down.
