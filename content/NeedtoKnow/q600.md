```
Given a positive integer n, find the number of non-negative integers less than or equal to n, whose binary representations do NOT contain consecutive ones.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
0 : 0
1 : 1
2 : 10
3 : 11
4 : 100
5 : 101
Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule. 
```

Let's say the number without consecutive ones is called "good number".
To count the number of "good number" with less than or equal to N bits is straight forward. 
In brief, we can maintain some states like the number of "good number" with at most j bits that **ends with zero or one**.
With this setting up, we can have some recursion like:

* `ngood_end_with_1[j] = ngood_end_with_0[j - 1]`
* `ngood_end_with_0[j] = ngood_end_with_1[j - 1] + ngood_end_with_0[j - 1]`

OK, then the problem becomes how to count the number of "good number" <= the target (*and it takes me forever to get it right, and this motivates me the write it down ..*).

The initial idea is simple. 
Suppose the target is 10000, then we can simply count the "good number" with at most 4 bits (and add 1 at the end since we need to include 10000 as well).
Then for a more complex number like 10100, then we can count 4-bit "good number"s and count "good number" like 100XX which means counting 2-bit "good number".
Still, we need extra 1 to count 10100.
But what if we encounter 10110? 
Besides the 4-bit and 2-bit, we need to consider 1010X, essentially 1-bit. 
And no need to add extra 1 since we don't want to count 10110. 

So, we can scan from the leading "1" and count the n-bit "good number" and move to the next "1". 
If the "1" is right after another "1", we count the n-bit and then we can return since for number 11... then pattern 10X... has already included all "good number"s that is smaller than 11... .
If we are not returning immediately, we need to add extra 1 (as discussed above).

Another tip to note, we need to initialize the number of 0-bit "good number" as 1 since it actually means the number of 0-bit "good number" with leading zero (in the form of 0X). 
So, it is 1 rather than 0.

Taking together, we have the Python submission.

class Solution:
    def findIntegers(self, num: int) -> int:
        if num <= 1:
            return num + 1
        num_str = "{0:b}".format(num)
        ngood_array = [ [ 0, 0 ] for i in range(len(num_str)) ]
        ngood_array[1][0] = 1
        ngood_array[1][1] = 1
        ngood_array[0][0] = 1
        for j in range(2, len(ngood_array)):
            ngood_array[j][0] = ngood_array[j - 1][0] + ngood_array[j - 1][1]
            ngood_array[j][1] = ngood_array[j - 1][0]
        res = sum(ngood_array[len(num_str) - 1])
        pos = 1
        prev = '1'
        while pos < len(num_str):
            if num_str[pos] == '1':
                res += sum(ngood_array[len(num_str) - pos - 1])
                if prev == '1':
                    return res
                
            prev = num_str[pos]
            pos += 1
        return res + 1
```
